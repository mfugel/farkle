Plase note:
This game is under construction and has bugs as I attempt to add enhancements and fix bugs ongoing.  
If you encounter a bug, please let me know and i will add it to issues. 

The scoring rules i will first implement are the easy scoring that i use for my 96 year old mom. My intent is to allow for different variations of scoring and allowing the user to select which rules to play. 

The intent here is create this game as a single web page and allow it to be played from a browser, either on your computer, tablet or phone. I may investigate creating it as a genuine mobile app, but that will be in the future.
